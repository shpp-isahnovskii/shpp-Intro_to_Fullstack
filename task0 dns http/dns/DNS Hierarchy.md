**DNS servers** are organized in a hierarchical order and communicate with each other through private network protocols. The master DNS servers, known as root servers, store the whole database of the Internet domain names and their corresponding IP addresses. They are owned by various independent agencies based in the United States, Japan, the UK and Sweden. The other lower-level DNS servers maintain only parts of the total database of the domains/addresses and are owned by businesses or ISPs (Internet Server Providers). A DNS server can be any computer registered in the DNS system, running special DNS software, which helps it resolve domain names to their appropriate hosts. Each DNS server features a public IP address and includes a database of network names/addresses of other Internet hosts.
